INFO:root:The Overwatch League (OWL) was a professional esports league for the video game Overwatch, developed by Blizzard Entertainment. It aimed to create a structured competitive environment for Overwatch, featuring teams from various cities around the world. The league was notable for its city-based franchise model, similar to traditional sports leagues.

The OWL began its inaugural season in 2018 and quickly gained popularity, attracting a large audience and significant sponsorship deals. Teams competed in regular season matches, followed by playoffs and a grand finals event to determine the league champion.

The league faced various challenges, including issues related to player contracts, team performance, and the overall sustainability of the esports ecosystem. Despite these challenges, the OWL played a crucial role in promoting esports and establishing a professional framework for competitive gaming.
